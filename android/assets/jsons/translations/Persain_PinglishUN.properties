# If you want to add new translations, please follow these guidelines (for unification purposes):
# Please note that the letter ع(ein) does not have a direct translation, Simply because there is no need to, like in “edaalat”(=justice) or “abas”(=vain) however, In words like “Sa’adi”(a famous poet) where the /∅/ is tangible, I opted to use apostrophe (‘) and put the two vowels that are heard before and after ‘ein’ around it, Like in Sa’adi (sa + a + di) you hear ‘a’ before and after ‘ein’, In a word like “sa’aadat” (=happiness, felicity, well-being) since its pronounced as (sa + aa + dat), I put “a’aa” instead of ‘ein’.
# If you encountered a word which had ‘tashdid’ (it was intensified in pronunciation), Like “Mohabbat” (=kindness) just write the vowel that was intensified twice.
# Don’t use ‘u’ instead of ‘oo’ (like “rood” (= river) instead of “rud”).
# Avoid using ‘ee’ as much as possible, use ‘i’instead (like “khaatere i khoob” (= a good memory), instead of “khaatere ee khoob”)
# And also just like English, use capital letters for special names and at the beginning of sentences.
# To make the translations more in line with the contemporaneous Persian language I have changed some nouns to a more common one, or something that makes sense, like there is no direct translation for ‘warpath’ so considering the phrase (The Great Warpath) I opted to translate it as ‘warrior’ instead.
# PLEASE NOTE! This alphabet was derivated from “ALA_LC” standard. It is also similar to the standard approved by the United Nations before their 2012 review
