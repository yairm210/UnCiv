Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = 您好，歡迎來到絢麗多彩的UnCiv遊戲世界！\n文明遊戲是復雜的，讓我們通過一些簡單的任務來熟悉它吧。\n這些任務是可選的，當然您也可以自己探索遊戲世界！
Your first mission is to found your capital city.\nThis is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous.\nMany game bonuses apply only to your capital city and it will probably be the center of your empire. = 您的第一个任务是建立首都，\n这个任务是非常重要的，因为通常情况下首都会成为你的文明最繁荣的城市。\n游戏中解锁政策、科技等带来的很多增益往往只对首都有效，所以首都的发展代表了您的文明的发达程度。
How do you know a spot is appropriate?\nThat’s not an easy question to answer, but looking for and building next to luxury resources is a good rule of thumb.\nLuxury resources are tiles that have things like gems, cotton, or silk (indicated by a smiley next to the resource icon)\nThese resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as iron. = 如何选择一个合适的首都建立位置？这不是一个容易回答的问题。\n通常情况下，选择紧邻奢侈资源的位置是选择建立点的不二法则。\n奢侈资源主要包括宝石、棉花、丝绸等（这些资源在地图上用一个“笑脸”标示），\n开发这些资源可以增加您的文明的快乐。当然，你也应该留意那些组建单位时所需要的战略资源，比如铁。
However, cities don’t have a set area that they can work - more on that later!\nThis means you don’t have to settle cities right next to resources.\nLet’s say, for example, that you want access to some iron – but the resource is right next to a desert.\nYou don’t have to settle your city next to the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands.\nYour city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource.\nYou only need to settle right next to resources if you need them immediately – \n   which might be the case now and then, but you’ll usually have the luxury of time. = 但是，城市的边界不是固定的，它会随着文化的积累慢慢扩张。\n这意味着你并不一定要把城市建在太过靠近资源的位置。\n举例来说，比如, 你需要获得战略资源铁--但悲剧的是该资源紧邻沙漠。\n您无需把城市建立在紧邻沙漠的位置。相反的，可以选择离该资源稍远而且更加富饶的地块。\n随着城市的不断繁荣发展和边界的扩张，城市将慢慢靠近该资源直至获得它。\n如果需要马上获得所需的战略资源你可以选择建城在靠近资源的位置--\n有时候这样做可能对游戏的胜利更有利，但通常情况下您都有充裕的时间选择更加合理的建立点。
The first thing coming out of your city should be either a Scout or Warrior.\nI generally prefer the Warrior because it can be used for defense and because it can be upgraded\n  to the Swordsman unit later in the game for a relatively modest sum of gold.\nScouts can be effective, however, if you seem to be located in an area of dense forest and hills.\nScouts don’t suffer a movement penalty in this terrain.\nIf you’re a veteran of the 4x strategy genre your first Warrior or Scout will be followed by a Settler.\nFast expanding is absolutely critical in most games of this type. = 您的城市第一個組建的單位應當是勇士或斥候。\n我非常喜歡勇士，因為他可以用於防守，\n同時在研發“鐵器”科技後只需花少量的金錢就可以把他升級為劍士。\n當您的城市位於大片森林或丘陵間時斥候是非常有效的選擇，\n因為他在這些地形移動時沒有移動力懲罰。\n如果您是4x遊戲的行家裏手，緊隨第一個勇士或斥候的單位應該是移民。\n請記住：快速擴張永遠是獲取勝利的不二法門！
In your first couple of turns,\n  you will have very little options,\n  but as your civilization grows, so do the \n  number of things requiring your attention = 在游戏开始的最初几回合，\n您只需进行很少的操作。\n但随着您的文明的发展，\n很多事情必须面面俱到。
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your \n  cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a \n  Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = 文化可以通過建設文化建築或奇觀、推行社會政策等累積。\n當您有足夠的文化點數時, 可以推行一項社會政策，\n每項社會政策都會給您一定的獎勵。
The policies are organized into branches, with each\n  branch providing a bonus ability when all policies \n  in the branch have been adopted. = 社會政策被話分成幾個分支，每個分支都有自己的子政策，\n當一個分支社會政策的所有子政策都被推行，\n會有一個額外的獎勵。
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = 隨著每項社會政策的推行，每座城市的建立，\n推行新的社會政策時的文化花費會隨之提升--所以要明智地選擇!
As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = 随着城市规模扩大，城市的可工作地块也会变得越来越多。\n这时，你将不得不面对游戏中关于“快乐”的机制。在游戏中，快乐的产出是所有城市总和计算，\n快乐的消耗则由城市数量和人口数量决定。\n随着城市数量的增加和城市人口的增长您将会很快发现：保持你的文明始终处于快乐是一件越来越难的事。
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = 此外，在未研发相关科技前您将无法建造任何能增加快乐的建筑、奇观和开发可以增加快乐的奢侈资源。\n如果您的文明处于不满，将会极大地减慢城市发展速度。\n如果文明的不满状态非常严重（顶部信息栏用一个“哭脸”标示），\n您的部队战斗力将会有极大的减成。
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn’t do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 这意味着在Unciv游戏中快速扩张是一件非常困难的事，新手们一定要十分慎重。\n那么究竟应该如何做呢？把目光聚焦在发展自己已有的城市上吧。\n通过组建工人建造设施、开发资源，同时不要放松对其他文明的侦查工作，\n只有当您在寻找到一个合适的位置后再来建立新的城市吧。
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, cities  will grow at 1/4 the speed,\n  and your units will suffer a 2% penalty for each unhappiness = 看来您的市民不太高兴!\n因为不满(快乐为负)，城市的食物产出将-75%，\n每1点不满会使您的单位战斗力-2%。
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = 产生不满的原因有两个:人口数和城市数，\n每座城市产生3点不满，每个市民产生1点不满。
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders = 有两种方法可以减少不满:\n为您的市民建造提供快乐的建筑或奇观，\n或者开发奢侈资源。
You have entered a golden age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = 您的文明进入了一个黄金时代!\n您的快乐每个回合都会积累，\n当快乐积累到一定数值就会开启一个黄金时代。\n在黄金时代，文化和产能积累速率+20%，\n每个至少产出1金钱的地块将提供额外的金钱。
Connecting your cities to the capital by roads\n  will generate gold via the trade route.\nNote that each road costs 1 gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 gold,\n  so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = 您已经建立了第二座城市!\n通过道路连接您的城市和首都来建立贸易路线，\n贸易路线将提供额外的金钱产出。\n请注意，道路经过的每个地块都需要1金钱的维护费，\n所以等待城市的自然发展可能更经济!
Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = 当您建立了两三座城市后，可能已经经过了100～150回合，\n这时您应该思考和谋划如何赢得游戏的胜利--如果此时你还没有胜利的话！
There are three ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri = 在Unciv游戏中，有三种赢得胜利的方式。分别是：\n文化胜利--完成4个社会政策分支；\n征服胜利--消灭其他文明成为世界上唯一的存在；\n科技胜利--成为第一个建造太空飞船飞向遥远的半人马阿尔法星的文明。
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness,\n   and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 小心谋划、认真算计、稳扎稳打、步步为营，这是游玩Unciv游戏的基本法则。\n首先建立一座繁荣的城市，确保快乐不为负的情况下慢慢扩张，渐渐成长为一方强权，\n向着你设定的胜利目标勇敢前进吧！\n这是勇敢者的游戏，需要的不仅是智谋和勇气，请尽情享受吧！不过，请注意：鲁莽与草率是通向死亡的快车道！
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1,\n  and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units\n  and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = 您已经包围了敌人的一座城市!\n当城市的耐久降至1时就可以被占领。\n只能使用近战单位占领城市。\n城市每回合会自动回复少许耐久，所以最好先使用远程单位攻击它，\n同时使用您的近战单位来保护远程单位，直到城市被占领!
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = 您已经获得了第一个奢侈资源!\n您拥有的每种独一无二的奢侈资源都会给您的文明+5快乐，\n每种奢侈资源只能提供一份快乐加成，同种的多个资源并不会提供更多的快乐，\n所以用它们和其他文明进行贸易吧!
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own. = 您已经获得了第一个战略资源!\n战略资源允许您组建特定的单位和建造特定的建筑。\n当您在一个战略资源地块上建造了设施，它将为您提供有限数量的该种资源。\n组建相关单位和建造相关建筑时这些资源会消耗。如需要消耗1单位的马来组建1个骑手，\n没有马就不能组建骑手。当该单位或建筑被摧毁时，此资源将能再次使用。\n如果获取资源途径出现中断，需要该资源的单位将受到战斗力减成，直至重新获得该资源。
The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = 这座城市再也不能抵抗了!\n然而，要征服城市，请使用您的近战单位占领它。
When conquering a city, you can now choose to either  or raze, puppet, or annex the city.\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed. = 恭喜！您已经攻占了一座敌人的城市！\n您可以选择摧毁、傀儡甚至吞并它。\n“摧毁城市”可以令城市人口每回合-1，人口为0时城市将完全被摧毁。
Puppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost, but its citizens will generate 1.5x the regular unhappiness.\nAnnexing the city will give you control over the production, but will increase the citizen's unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state! = “傀儡城市”意味着您将无法控制该城市的产能，\n好处是该城市将不会额外增加您研发科技和推行社会政策时的花费，同时该城市人口产生的不满是正常值的1.5倍。\n“吞并城市”将会给予您该城市的绝对控制权，但该城市人口产生的不满将是正常值的2倍。\n在城市内建造“法庭”可以使人口产生的不满降低到正常值。\n可以在任何时候吞并已傀儡的城市，但已吞并的城市无法再变为傀儡状态。选择前请考虑清楚！
You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 您遇到蛮族了!\n蛮族会不分青红皂白地攻击靠近它的每一个单位，\n所以请不要让您的移民等平民单位靠近他们，同时还要注意你的斥候!
You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = 您遇到了另一个文明!\n其他文明一开始是和平的，您可以和他们进行贸易，\n但是他们以后可能会选择对您宣战。
Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a scientific victory! = 您已经完成了阿波罗计划！\n现在可以开始在您的城市中建造飞船部件了，\n来通过太空竞赛赢得科技胜利吧！
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive\nUnits heal 5 health per turn in enemy territory, 10 in neutral land,\n  15 inside your territory and 20 in your cities = 您的一个单位受伤了!\n受伤的单位造成的伤害比未受伤时少，他们的生命值在不进行任何操作时可以回复。\n每回合生命值回复量取决于单位所处的位置：\n敌方领土时5点，中立领土时10点，己方领土时15点，城市中心地块时20点。
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = 您训练了一个工人!\n工人对您所在城市的发展至关重要，因为只有他们才能在地块上建造设施。\n设施可以提高地块的产出，\n当市民在建有设施的地块工作时，将给您的城市带来更多的收益。
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = 您训练了一支攻城单位!\n攻城单位对城市具有极强的毁灭力，但在进攻前必须先把它架设起来。\n您的攻城单位架设起来后，它就可以从当前的地块发起攻击，\n但是一旦它移动到其他地块，就需要重新架设。
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn.\nUnits are defenseless while embarked, so be careful! = 您的陆军单位现在拥有船运能力，他们可以穿越海洋地块!\n陆军单位进入或离开水域后，当前回合内将不能再进行任何操作。\n陆军单位处于船运状态在海上行进时是没有防御能力的，所以请小心!
Your citizens can work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThe city border will keep expanding,\n   but citizens cannot be assigned to faraway tiles. = 市民可以在距城市中心地块3格以内处于您文明影响范围内的地块上工作。\n虽然城市的边界会持续地扩张，\n但是市民不能分配在距城市中心地块3格以外的地块上。
If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again.\nIf you won't be moving it for a while, you can have the unit enter Fortify or Sleep mode - \n  units in Fortify or Sleep are not considered idle units.\nIf you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Menu -> Check for idle units = 如果当前回合不想对某个单位执行任何操作，可以点击右上方“下个闲置单位”按钮来跳过该单位。\n如果一段时间内不想对其执行任何操作，可以对该单位执行“驻守”或“休眠”指令，\n系统执行“回合结束前查看未行动单位”指令时将自动跳过处于“驻守”或“休眠”状态的单位。\n如果想完全禁用“下个闲置单位”按钮，请进入“设置”菜单并将“回合结束前查看闲置单位”设置为“否”。
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably\n  seen that the game is currently incomplete.\nUnCiv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n  That means no ads or any other nonsense. = 您好!玩到这里，您已经熟悉了游戏的全部内容，\n您会发现游戏目前是不完整的，它还处于开发状态。\n不过UnCiv将永远是开源和免费的，\n这意味着您无须担心广告或付费问题。
What motivates me to keep working on it, \n  besides the fact I think it's amazingly cool that I can,\n  is the support from the players - you guys are the best! = 您的支持将激励着我进一步完善它，\n我一定会竭尽全力、精益求精。\n感谢玩家们的支持--您们是最棒的!
Every rating and review that I get puts a smile on my face =)\n  So contact me! Send me an email, review, Github issue\n  or mail pigeon, and let's figure out how to make the game \n  even more awesome!\n(Contact info is in the Play Store) = 如果喜欢它，请到Play Store对它进行评价。\n如果您发现了游戏存在的问题或有什么好的意见和建议，\n请联系我！\n我的email地址：yairm210@hotmail.com，\nGitHub项目页面：https://github.com/yairm210/UnCiv。
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch. = 军事单位可以劫掠地块设施，“劫掠”可以回复单位25点生命值同时将设施化为废墟。\n被“劫掠”的地块仍旧可以工作，但从地块设施获得的效果————例如基本资源加成和战略资源收益————将会消失。\n工人可以修复这些化为废墟的设施，所花费时间将比重新建造它们要少。
