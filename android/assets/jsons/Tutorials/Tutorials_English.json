	New_Game: [
		[
			"Hello, and welcome to Unciv!",
			"Civilization games can be complex, so we'll  be guiding you step-by-step.",
			"Your first mission is to found your capital city.",
			"This is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous.",
			"Many game bonuses apply only to your capital city and it will probably be the center of your empire."
		],
		[
			"How do you know a spot is appropriate?",
			"That’s not an easy question to answer, but looking for and building next to luxury resources is a good rule of thumb.",
			"Luxury resources are tiles that have things like gems, cotton, or silk (indicated by a smiley next to the resource icon)",
			"These resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as iron."
		],
		[
			"However, cities don’t have a set area that they can work - more on that later!"
			"This means you don’t have to settle cities right next to resources.",
			"Let’s say, for example, that you want access to some iron – but the resource is right next to a desert."
			"You don’t have to settle your city next to the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands.",
			"Your city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource.",
			"You only need to settle right next to resources if you need them immediately – ",
			"   which might be the case now and then, but you’ll usually have the luxury of time."
		],
		
	],
	
	
	_City_Founded : [
		[
			"You have founded a city!",
			"Cities are the lifeblood of your empire, providing gold and science empire-wide,",
			"  which are displayed on the top bar.",
			"You can click the city name to enter  the city screen to assign population,",
			"  choose production, and see information on the city"
		],
	]
	
	First_Steps : [
		[
			"Once you have your first city up and running you’ll be able to start production of a new unit",
			"  and you’ll be able to begin your research.",
			"I’m not going to delve too deeply into the research element of the game yet – that will be handled later in the guide –",
			"  so let’s just talk about production."
		],
		[
			"The first thing coming out of your city should be either a Scout or Warrior."
			"I generally prefer the Warrior because it can be used for defense and because it can be upgraded",
			"  to the Swordsman unit later in the game for a relatively modest sum of gold.",
			"Scouts can be effective, however, if you seem to be located in an area of dense forest and hills.",
			"Scouts don’t suffer a movement penalty in this terrain."
			"If you’re a veteran of the 4x strategy genre your first Warrior or Scout will be followed by a Settler.",
			"Fast expanding is absolutely critical in most games of this type.",
		],

			"  click the next turn button on the top right to continue."

		]
	],

	Slow_Start: [
		[
			"In your first couple of turns,",

		]

	Culture_and_Policies: [ // Activated when entering policy picker screen
		[
			"Each turn, the culture you gain from all your ",
			"  cities is added to your Civilization's culture.",
			"When you have enough culture, you may pick a ",
			"  Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus."
		],
		[
			"The policies are organized into branches, with each",
			"  branch providing a bonus ability when all policies ",
			"  in the branch have been adopted."
		],
		[
			"With each policy adopted, and with each city built,",
			"  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely!"
		]
	],
	
	Cities: [
		[
			"Each population in your city can work a single tile, providing the city with that tile's yields.",
			"Population can be assigned and unassigned by clicking on the tiles - ",
			"  but of course, you can only assign population if you have idle population to spare!"
		],
		[
			"The center tile of a city is always worked, and doesn't require population,",
			"  but it cannot be improved by tile improvements."
			"The city's production always goes towards the current construction - ",
			"  you can pick the city's construction by clicking on the construction button on the bottom-left"
		]
		[
			"Cities grow in population when you amass enough surplus food.",
			"Similarly, your city's borders grow when you amass enough culture,",
			"  which is not generated by tiles but rather by buildings."
		],
	],
	
	Technology: [
		[
			"Technology is central to your civilization,",
			" as technological progress brings with it",
			" more construction options, improvements, and abilities"
		],
		[
			"Most technologies are dependent on other technologies being researched - ",
			"  but you can choose a technology to aspire to,",
			"  and your civilization will research the necessary technologies to get there"
		]
	],
	
	
	
	
	Happiness:[
		[
			"As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.",
			"Instead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.",
			"As your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy."
		],
		[
			"In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.",
			"If your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.",
			"If your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)",
			"  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness."
		],
		[
			"This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv."
			"It isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn’t do it."
			"So what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.",
			"Only build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate."
		],

	Unhappiness:  [
		[
			"It seems that your citizens are unhappy!",
			"While unhappy, cities  will grow at 1/4 the speed,",
			"  and your units will suffer a 2% penalty for each unhappiness"
		],
		[
			"Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities",
			"  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1"
		],
		[
			"There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:",
			"  by building happiness buildings for your population",
			"  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders"
		]
	],
	
	Golden_Age:  [
		[
			"You have entered a golden age!",
			"Golden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness ",
			"  of your civilization",
			"When in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,",
			"  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold."
		]
	],
	
	Roads_and_Railroads:  [
		[
			"Connecting your cities to the capital by roads",
			"  will generate gold via the trade route.",
			"Note that each road costs 1 gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 gold,"
			"  so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow!"
		]
		
	]
	
	Victory_Types:[
		[
			"Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.",
			"Now is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already."
		],
		[
			"There are three ways to win in Unciv. They are:",
			" - Cultural Victory: Complete 4 Social Policy Trees",
			" - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization",
			" - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri"
		],
		[
			"So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness,",
			"   and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.",
			"Obviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim.",
		]
	]
	
	Enemy_City:  [
		[
			"Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1,",
			"  and entering the city with a melee unit.",
			"Since cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units"

	Luxury_Resource:  [
		[
			"Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.",
			"Each unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization,",
			"  but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, ",

	Strategic_Resource:  [
		[
			"Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.",
			"Strategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that",

	],

	After_Conquering: [
		[
			"When conquering a city, you can now choose to either  or raze, puppet, or annex the city.",
			"Razing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed."
		],
		[
			"Puppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.",
			"The city will not increase your tech or policy cost, but its citizens will generate 1.5x the regular unhappiness.",
			"Annexing the city will give you control over the production, but will increase the citizen's unhappiness to 2x!",
			"This can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.",
			"A puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed vities cannot be returned to a puppeted state!"

	Workers:[
		[
			"Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can onstruct improvements on tiles",

		[
			"Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.",
